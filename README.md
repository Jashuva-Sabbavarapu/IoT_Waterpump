# IoT Waterpump

I'm developing "IoT waterpump" which is an IoT system that constantly measures the water level using an ultrasonic sensor, and it has Auto and Manual mode which controls over the waterpump to control automatically or Manually. It communicates with the Firebase realtime data base. I also made a webpage using html, css, js which monitors and controls it. Managing all the tasks realtime using freeRTOS which manage the tasks in realtime.
